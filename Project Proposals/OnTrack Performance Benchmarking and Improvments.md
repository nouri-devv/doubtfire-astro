# OnTrack Performance Tracking and Optimization Proposal

## Tracking Performance

### Google Lighthouse

Google Lighthouse can be used to track performance of OnTrack on key
metrics such as **Performance**, **Accessibility**, **Best Practice**,
and **SEO**.\
The most important metric would be **Performance** in this case
(currently OnTrack scores **68/100** on the Home page and **62/100** on
a Unit page) and relevant sub metrics such as *First Contentful Paint*,
*Largest Contentful Paint*, and others.

### Un-Lighthouse

Un-Lighthouse is a spin-off from Google Lighthouse, which allows
inspection of performance metrics of the **entire website**, rather than
each page.\
This tool can also be used alongside Google Lighthouse to track key
metrics.

### Web Vitals Plugin

A Google Chrome extension which allows us to inspect specific elements
in a page that cause bottlenecks when loading.
